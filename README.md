## Why?

- fast iteration speed â€” save a file and database is updated in milliseconds
- roll-forward only â€” maintaining rollbacks is a chore, and in 10 years of API
  development I've never ran one in production
- familiar â€” no custom DSL to learn, just use PostgreSQL syntax
- fully functional â€” sending SQL commands directly to PostgreSQL means you can
  use all of PostgreSQL's features
- complements [PostGraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile/) â€” works with
  any application, but PostGraphile's watch mode means that the GraphQL schema
  is instantly regenerated (without server restart) whenever the database
  changes

## Status

**HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL**

If you're a sponsor and you're using this software, let me know so I can justify
allocating additional time to it.

The interface is raw and doesn't ask for confirmation (e.g. the
`graphile-migrate reset` command will drop and re-create that database without
asking for confirmation).

There are no automated tests yet, and APIs may still change. (Pull requests to
add tests welcome!)

Using this for prototyping should be fine, but when it comes to shipping you may
want to

- help us write tests and finalise interfaces
- send us money to do the same
- use an alternative migration framework, such as:
  - [db-migrate](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting%20Started/commands/)
  - [sqitch](https://sqitch.org/)
  - [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
  - [migra](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra)

## Opinions

- Local iteration should be easy and _fast_
- Migrating should be fast
- Once deployed, databases should be identical (including subtleties such as
  column order)
- Migration software should not be tied to a particular application stack
- Migrations should be written in SQL
- Roll-forward only (production issues should be fixed via additional
  migrations, development can iterate current migration)
- Once a migration is signed off (deployable) it should never be edited
- Use PostgreSQL ;)
- Development databases are cheap; can run multiple
- Resetting development database is acceptable if absolutely necessary
- Production databases are critical - NEVER RESET
- Migrating data (as well as DDL) is acceptable, but should be kept to fast
  operations (or trigger a background job)
- Migrations should automatically be wrapped in transactions by default
- Migrations that require execution outside of a transaction (e.g. to enable
  augmenting non-DDL-safe things, such as `ENUM`s in PostgreSQL) should be
  explicitly marked
- Migrations should not pollute PostgreSQL global settings (e.g. use `SET LOCAL`
  rather than `SET`)
- Roles should be managed outside of migrations (since they can be shared
  between databases)
- Certain schemas are managed by other tools and should not be interfered with;
  e.g. `graphile_jobs`

## Setup

`graphile-migrations` requires two databases: the first is your main database
against which you perform development, the second is a "shadow" database which
is used by the system to apply migrations. You should never interact with the
"shadow" database directly. Further all members of your team should run the same
PostgreSQL version to ensure that the shadow dump matches for everyone (one way
of achieving this is through Docker, but that isn't required).

## Usage

### `graphile-migrate migrate [--shadow] [--force]`

Runs any un-executed committed migrations. Does **not** run `current.sql`. For
use in production and development.

If `--shadow` is specified, migrates the shadow database instead.

If `--force` is specified, it will run any `afterAllMigrations` actions even if
no migrations are actually ran.

### `graphile-migrate watch [--shadow] [--once]`

Runs any un-executed committed migrations and then runs and watches
`current.sql`, re-running its contents on any change.

`current.sql` should be idempotent (this is your responsibility, see
"Idempotency" below); i.e. it should be able to be ran multiple times and have
the same result.

If `--shadow` is specified, changes will be applied against the shadow database
instead.

If `--once` is specified, `current.sql` will be ran once and then the command
will exit.

### `graphile-migrate commit`

- reset the shadow database to the latest dump
- apply the current migration to the shadow database, and replace the dump
- move the current migration to committed migrations (adding a hash to prevent
  tampering)

### `graphile-migrate uncommit`

Moves the latest committed migration back to `current.sql` and deletes the
committed migration from the filesystem and from the database migrations table.
Will only work when `current.sql` is empty(ish).

Do **NOT** use it once other systems have ran the commit. This is for use during
development only, probably before your changes are pushed/merged.

### `graphile-migrate reset [--shadow]`

Drop and re-create the database, and re-run all the committed migrations from
the start. **HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE**

If `--shadow` is specified, the shadow database will be reset rather than the
main database.

### `graphile-migrate status`

[EXPERIMENTAL!]

Exits with a bitmap status code indicating statuses:

- 1 if there are committed migrations that have not been executed yet
- 2 if the `current.sql` file is non-empty (ignoring comments)

If both of the above are true then the output status will be 3 (1+2). If neither
are true, exit status will be 0 (success).

Also outputs helpful messages:

```
There are 3 committed migrations pending:

  000001.sql
  000002.sql
  000003.sql

The current.sql migration is not empty and has not been committed.
```

## Library usage

It's possible to consume this module as a JavaScript library rather than via the
CLI. There's no documentation on this, but the CLI code in `cli.ts` is very
approachable.

ALPHA WARNING: internals are likely to change a lot, so expect breakage if you
use library mode right now. CLI is more stable.

## Configuration

Configuration goes in `.gmrc`, which is a JSON file with the following keys:

- `connectionString` (or `DATABASE_URL` envvar) â€” this is your main development
  database. If you run `graphile-migrate reset` this will be dropped without
  warning, so be careful.
- `shadowConnectionString` (or `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` envvar) â€” the shadow
  database which will be dropped frequently, so don't store anything to it that
  you care about. **This database should not already exist.**
- `rootConnectionString` (or `ROOT_DATABASE_URL` envvar) â€” this is used to
  connect to the database server with superuser privileges to drop and re-create
  the relevant databases (via the `reset` command directly, or via the `commit`
  command for the shadow database). It **must not** be a connection to the
  database in `connectionString` or `shadowConnectionString`. It defaults to
  "template1" if the key or environment variable is not set so it may result in
  PG connection errors if a default PG `template1` database is not available.
- `pgSettings` â€” optional string-string key-value object defining settings to
  set in PostgreSQL when migrating. Useful for setting `search_path` for
  example. Beware of changing this, a full reset will use the new values which
  may lead to unexpected consequences.
- `placeholders` â€” optional string-string key-value object defining placeholder
  values to be replaced when encountered in any migration files. Placeholders
  must begin with a colon and a capital letter, and then can continue with a
  string of capital letters, numbers and underscores `/^:[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+$/`.
  `:DATABASE_NAME` and `:DATABASE_OWNER` are automatically added to this object.
  The value must be a valid in the place you use it (i.e. ensure you escape the
  values) â€” graphile-migrate does not perform any escaping for you. The special
  value `!ENV` will tell graphile-migrate to load the setting from the
  environment variable with the same name.
- `afterReset` â€” optional list of actions to execute after the database has been
  created but before the migrations run, useful to set default permissions,
  install extensions or install external schemas like `graphile-worker` that
  your migrations may depend on. See "Actions" below.
- `afterAllMigrations` â€” optional list of actions to execute after all the
  migrations have ran, useful for performing a tasks like dumping the database
  or regenerating dependent data (GraphQL schema, type definitions, etc). See
  "Actions" below.
- `afterCurrent` â€” optional list of actions to execute after `current.sql` is
  loaded into the database. See "Actions" below.
- `manageGraphileMigrateSchema` (defaults to `true`) â€” if set to `false`, you
  assume responsibility for managing the `graphile_migrate` schema. **Not
  recommended.** This is useful in environments where the user running the
  migrations isn't granted schema creation privileges. If you set this to
  `false`, you must be sure to migrate the `graphile_migrate` database schema
  any time you update the `graphile-migrate` module.

What follows is an example configuration file that depends on the following
environmental variables being set:

- `ROOT_DATABASE_URL` - equivalent to `rootConnectionString` above, e.g.
  `postgres://localhost/template1`
- `DATABASE_URL` - equivalent to `connectionString` above, e.g.
  `postgres://my_user:my_password@localhost/my_db`
- `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` - equivalent to `shadowConnectionString` above, e.g.
  `postgres://my_user:my_password@localhost/my_db_shadow` (should use same
  credentials as the )

```json
{
  "pgSettings": {
    "search_path": "app_public,app_private,app_hidden,public"
  },
  "placeholders": {
    ":DATABASE_AUTHENTICATOR": "!ENV",
    ":DATABASE_VISITOR": "!ENV"
  },
  "afterReset": [
    "afterReset.sql",
    { "_": "command", "command": "npx --no-install graphile-worker --once" }
  ],
  "afterAllMigrations": [
    {
      "_": "command",
      "command": "pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner --exclude-schema=graphile_migrate --file=data/schema.sql \"$GM_DBURL\""
    }
  ],
  "afterCurrent": ["afterCurrent.sql"]
}
```

### Windows

Since committed migrations utilize hashes to verify file integrity, the
difference between LF and CRLF line endings on \*nix and Windows will cause the
hash verification to fail. Git's default/recommended approach to line endings is
to convert back and forth depending on your platform. To work around this, we
recommend adding a `.gitattributes` file to force LF line endings for the
committed migrations on all platforms:

```
migrations/committed/*.sql text eol=lf
migrations/current.sql text eol=lf
```

After committing this change, you may run `git checkout-index --force --all` to
rewrite the working copy with LF line endings. If that command does not replace
the CRLF line endings, you may need to delete your copy of the repo and
re-clone.

## Actions

We support certain "actions" after certain events happen; for example see
`afterReset`, `afterAllMigrations` and `afterCurrent` mentioned above. Actions
should be specified as a list of strings or action spec objects.

### Actions spec strings

String values are converted to `sql` action specs (see below) with the `file`
property set to the string. I.e. they indicate a file within the `migrations`
folder to execute against the database.

### Action spec objects

Action spec objects are plain JSON objects with the following properties:

- `_` - specifies the type of object (see supported types below)
- `shadow` (optional) - if set, must be a boolean; `true` indicates the action
  should only occur against the shadow DB, `false` indicates that the action
  should not occur against the shadow DB, unset runs against both databases

Each action spec subtype can have its own properties

#### `sql` action spec

e.g.

```json
{
  "_": "sql",
  "file": "install_extensions.sql"
}
```

The `file` indicates the name of a SQL file in the `migrations/` folder to
execute against the database (e.g. to set permissions, load data, install
extensions, etc).

#### `command` action spec

e.g.

```json
{
  "_": "command",
  "command": "npx --no-install graphile-worker --once"
}
```

`command` actions specify shell actions (e.g. running an external command such
as `graphile-worker` which might install a separately managed worker schema into
the database, or running something like `pg_dump` to dump the schema).

When the command is invoked it will have access to the following envvars:

- `GM_DBURL` - the relevant database URL (e.g. the one that was just
  reset/migrated)
- `GM_DBNAME` - the database name in `GM_DBURL`; you might use this if you need
  to use separate superuser credentials to install extensions against the
  database
- `GM_DBUSER` - the database user in `GM_DBURL`
- `GM_SHADOW` - set to `1` if we're dealing with the shadow DB, unset otherwise

## Collaboration

The intention is that developers can work on different migrations in parallel,
and can switch between `git` branches - idempotent migrations using `CASCADE`
when dropping should make it possible to do this with little issue (other than
the implicit data loss of dropping tables/columns/etc).

`graphile-migrate commit`, on the other hand, should be linear - one way to
approach this is to only commit a migration immediately before it is merged to
`master`. Another approach is to do the commit on `master` itself. Non-linear
migration commits will result in errors, and may lead to you resetting your
development database.

## Idempotency

`graphile-migrate` is all about iteration; you write your database modification
commands in `migrations/current.sql` and every time you save it is ran against
the database, generally taking under 100ms.

Because we run the same script over and over (on every save) and there's no down
migrations, you need to make your script idempotent. PostgreSQL has a number of
idempotent commands such as:

```sql
create or replace function...
drop table if exists ...
drop trigger if exists ...
-- etc
```

When these aren't suitable you can start your migration with an explicit
rollback: commands that undo later actions. For example:

```sql
-- undo
drop table if exists people;

-- redo
create table people (
  id serial primary key,
  name text
);
```

When it comes time to commit your migration we will run it against a "shadow"
database to make sure it's valid.

It's often wise to use `DROP ... CASCADE` so that if other migrations are worked
on in parallel no additional `rollback` step is required. When you
`DROP ... CASCADE`, be sure to add back any dropped dependents (triggers,
indexes, etc) once the dropped entity has been replaced. Reviewing the database
schema diff can help you spot these issues.

More examples of idempotent operations:

```sql
-- Create a schema
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS app CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA app;

-- Create a table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS foo CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE foo ...;

-- Add a column to the end of the table
ALTER TABLE foo DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS bar CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN foo ...;

-- Make a column NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN foo SET NOT NULL;

-- Alter a column type
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN foo TYPE int USING foo::int;

-- Change the body or flags of a function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ...;

-- Change a function signature (arguments, return type, etc)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ... CASCADE;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ...
```

## Disable Transaction

Some migrations require execution outside of a transaction (e.g. to enable
augmenting non-DDL-safe things, such as ENUMs in PostgreSQL). To disable
wrapping a given migration file in a transaction, use the special comment
`--! no-transaction` at the top of the migration file, e.g.

```sql
--! no-transaction
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'Admin';
```

**IMPORTANT**: `pg` always runs multi-statement queries in a pseudo-transaction,
so `--! no-transaction` migrations must contain exactly one statement. You might
be able to work around this with a `DO $$` block? (If this works, please send a
PR to this paragraph.)

## TODO:

- [ ] Use a proper CLI parsing library

- [ ] Store pgSettings with committed transactions to protect against user edits

- [ ] Add automated tests

- [ ] Add `graphile-migrate check` command: reset the shadow database to the
      latest dump, apply the current migration to the shadow database, and
      output a SQL schema diff you can use to ensure no accidental changes have
      been made

- [ ] Add `graphile-migrate init` command: ask questions and set up the relevant
      files for running graphile-migrate.

- [ ] Add `graphile-migrate import` command: used after init but before running
      any other commands, imports the existing database as if it were the first
      migration. (For now just pg_dump, and put the schema in
      migrations/schema.sql.)
